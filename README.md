# BinaryEncoder

This Projects main goal was to create my own binary encoding system, and then encode pixels into a png file.
There is 32 encoding characters that seperates as 16 lowercase, 16 uppercase. 
Files encode as 8 bit, 01010101 = aA, then every character is being painted in its own rgb representation

# Executing
Please Create input and output folder in the same directory
Put your input in input folder, then run main.py, remember to put only 1 file in input. 

For inspection, pixelColor.py and EncoderDecoder.py is a mapping that holds encoding pattern.
